The spatial-temporal movement of LiDAR is parameterized by a simple yet effective continuous-time trajectory, which consists of multiple piecewise linear functions. 
By coupling the geometric information from streaming LiDAR points and kinematic constraints from trajectory smoothness, it can work even in scenarios where the motion state exceeds the IMU's measuring range.
Besides, the framework is generalized for different kinds of LiDAR as well as multi-LiDAR systems.

## News: Traj-LO is accepted to [RA-L](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10387726)
As previously promised, the code for this project will be made open source. Due to my current focus on preparing for my doctoral dissertation, the upload of the code will not be delayed beyond March 1st, 2024.

Thanks for your attention.
